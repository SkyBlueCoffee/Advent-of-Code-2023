Day 06  
--Part One--  
You are given a sheet of paper (Day06Text.txt) that gives you a list of times allowed for a series of races, along with 
the record distances for each race. Time is measured in milliseconds and distance is measured in millimeters. You have a
toy boat with a red button, and for each millisecond you hold the button on the boat increases the distance it can go
by one millimeter per millisecond. The boat's starting speed is zero millimeters per millisecond. The race starts when you start
holding the button, so you must find the optimial times to hold the button to allow you to beat the record with the remaining time.
Determine the number of ways you can beat each record, and return the product of all these numbers.

--Part Two--  
It turns out there is only one race, and the paper you were given just has bad kerning. Now with a single race time, and single
record to beat, find how many ways you can beat the record in this longer race.
