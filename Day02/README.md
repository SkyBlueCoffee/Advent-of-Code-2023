Day 02  
--Part One--   
You are playing a game where a certain amount of red, blue, and green cubes are pulled from a bag. There are only 12 red cubes,
13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes in the bag. 100 games are played, each game containing several rounds. The results are held within
Day02.txt, each game is a new line and each round is sepreated by a semi-colon.
For each game played, detemine if the game is legal (i.e. if there are not more cubes pulled than are held in the bag), and
return the sum of the IDs of all legal games (Game 01 has ID 1, game 02 has ID 2, etc..)  
--Part Two--  
The power of a set of cubes is the number of all red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together. For each game, illegal or legal, find
the minimum set of cubes that must be present in order to play that game. Finally, return the sum of the power of these sets.
