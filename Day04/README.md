Day 04  
--Part One--  
You are given a series of scatchcards as puzzle input (Day04Text.txt), with two sets of numbers seperated by a vertical bar (|).
The first set of numbers are the winning numbers, and the second are the card's numbers. Points are awarded for each pair of
matching numbers, one point for the first match and double the amount for the subsequent. Considering the entire puzzle input,
find how many points the collection of cards is worth.

--Part Two--  
Instead of being awarded points, each pair of matching numbers now award you an additional copy of subsequent scratchcards (i.e.
four matching pairs will give you one more copy of the next four scratchcards). Including the original set of scratchcards,
how many total scratchcards do you end up with?
