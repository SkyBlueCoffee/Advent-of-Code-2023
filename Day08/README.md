Day 08  
--Part One--  
You're given a network of labeled nodes and a list of left/right instructions (Day08Text.txt). Each node has two linking nodes
that can be followed, one by stepping to the left and the other by stepping to the right. Your list of instructions tells
you which direction to head towards. You start at node AAA, and want to end at node ZZZ. If the list of left/right instructions
do not end you at node ZZZ, repeat the instructions from the begining until you do. How many steps in total does it take for
you to travel from node AAA to node ZZZ?
